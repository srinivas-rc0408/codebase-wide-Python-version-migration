"""CORRECT node: turn one test failure back into a green tree (FR-7).

The node reads a single entry from the ``mra:test_report`` the sandbox
produced (SRS §4.3) and runs the four steps of docs/04 §2.5:

    classify (V4-Flash)  ->  locate (analyzer + dep graph)
                         ->  patch (V4-Pro)  ->  apply

Two rules shape the whole module. **NB-4**: a corrective patch may never touch
a test file — the suite is the oracle, and repairing the oracle is how an agent
fakes a green run — so test paths are filtered out at localization and refused
again at apply. **NFR-12**: the patch prompt gets the failing file, the trace,
the contract and the graph slice around that file, and nothing else. Sending
the repo is how a long-horizon run runs out of context and out of budget.
