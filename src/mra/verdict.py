"""GREEN / YELLOW / RED: one answer to "can a human merge this patch?".

``verdict(run_artifacts)`` reads only what a run left behind (see
:func:`mra.report.load_run` for the keys) and returns ``{status, reasons}``.
Precedence is RED > YELLOW > GREEN; every reason that applies is listed, not
just the first, so the report can show the reviewer the whole picture.

* RED — the patch must not be merged as is: the precondition failed, the run
  crashed or gave up, the final suite is not green, the test oracle was
  touched, the patch does not apply to a fresh checkout, or a budget blew.
* YELLOW — the suite is green but the evidence is weaker than it looks:
  sites remain, it over-edited, a semantic check failed, lint got worse, a
  file could not be parsed, or an edited line never ran under any test.
* GREEN — none of the above.
